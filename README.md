AI Voice Assistant with Wikipedia and OpenAI Integration
Project Overview:

I developed an intelligent AI-powered voice assistant using Python that integrates OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model for advanced natural language understanding and response generation. The assistant is also capable of searching Wikipedia for quick information retrieval. This project utilizes voice recognition for hands-free operation, allowing users to interact via voice commands.

Key Features:

OpenAI GPT-3.5 Integration:
The assistant leverages OpenAI's GPT-3.5 for generating human-like responses to user queries, delivering insightful and context-aware answers in real-time.

Wikipedia Integration:
Users can ask questions about any topic, and the assistant will search Wikipedia, retrieving a summary of relevant information and presenting it both in text and voice format.

Voice Recognition and Command Execution:
Built using the speech_recognition and pyttsx3 libraries, the assistant listens to user commands, interprets them, and responds accordingly. Users can open websites, system files, check the current time, and more with simple voice commands.

Web Automation:
The assistant is capable of opening popular websites like YouTube, Google, and Wikipedia directly through voice commands, enabling seamless interaction.

System Utility:
The assistant can open system directories, media players (VLC), and Chrome browser, making it a personal productivity assistant.

Technologies Used:

Python: The primary language for the application.
OpenAI GPT-3.5: For generating natural language responses.
Wikipedia API: For fetching relevant information from Wikipedia.
Pyttsx3: For text-to-speech conversion.
SpeechRecognition: For interpreting voice commands.
Webbrowser & OS: To automate system-level tasks and open websites.
